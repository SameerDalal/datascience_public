## Overview

**Next Meetup**:

* Date/Time: 13 Nov 2022, 2-4pm ET
* Location: South County Regional Library
* Address: 5801 Rea Rd, Charlotte, NC 28277

Welcome to the CMSCA Data Science Student Project! This project is open to any youth, regardless of prior programming experience.

We will meet ~1x per month to explore and learn new data science concepts. The classes herein are structured so each class will be useful in and of itself. For participants who join all the sessions, we'll tie everything together at the end by using everything we've learned to build a [network graph](https://vizartpandey.com/how-to-plot-a-network-graph-with-tableau/) of a chess player and the results of their prior matches.

### What is Data Science?

Data Science is the process of using data to ask questions, attempt to answer them, and then use the results to tell a story.  In a nutshell, Data Science is a very broad field involving all sorts of data, diverse, and still emerging.  Lots of exciting opportunities expected over the coming years.

### What does a Data Scientist do?

A Data Scientist uses their skills to understand the data challenge at hand to define an approach to get to the solution and then tell the story.

### Why is it important?

There are many fields with large amounts of data such as medicine, environmental, financial, and transportation needing to explore solutions to common problems.  For example, the next cancer breakthrough could be uncovered by the help of Data Scientists.

### Key Skills

The Key Skills needed to be a successful Data Scientist is curiosity, open mindedness, mathematics, statistics, software development, writing/presentation skills, and people/soft skills.

### Related Course Work

Course work that can help you today to start preparing to become a data scientist is English, Mathematics, Science, and Coding Courses (e.g. Python).

### Salary Range

With just a few years of experience, a Data Scientist can expect to earn over $100,000/year.

### Famous Data Scientists

* [Timnit Gebru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timnit_Gebruhttps:/): is a well known Scientist who is fighting for fairness and accountability in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining.  She is considered one of the world's most influential people in this field.
* [Kira Radinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kira_Radinsky) was born in Ukraine and gained recognition when she predicted via data mining the first outbreak of Cholera in Cuba in over 130 years.
* [Caitlin Smallwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinsmallwood) is the VP of Data Science at Netflix where she led significant breakthroughs with user's decision and predictive models and algorithms.  This led to better personalization of customer's movie recommendations.

### Industries that need Data Scientists

Any industry that collects data would benefit from having a Data Scientist to help them better understand their data and to uncover insights that will bring great value.

## Agenda

### Setting up your Development Environment (30 Oct 2022)

* Class Notes: [https://github.com/cmsca/datascience_public/blob/main/setting_up.md](https://github.com/cmsca/datascience_public/blob/main/setting_up.md)

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant has their local development environment set up for the classes to follow. We'll cover:

- [ ] Installing [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [ ] Installing a text editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- [ ] Installing the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
- [ ] Creating a virtual environment
- [ ] PIP Installing Python libraries

### Intro to Python (13 Nov 2022)

* Date/Time: 13 Nov 2022, 2-4pm ET
* Location: South County Regional Library
* Address: 5801 Rea Rd, Charlotte, NC 28277
* Class Notes:

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is comfortable enough with Python to enjoy and learn from the course.

- [ ] Variables, expressions, statements
- [ ] Conditional execution
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Loops and iterations
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Dictionaries

### TBA | Intro to Web Scraping

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant feels comfortable with the basics of web scraping in Python. We'll cover:

- [ ] Understanding the robots.txt file
- [ ] 'Netiquette'
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Requests
- [ ] Beautiful Soup

### TBA | Into to SQLite

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with the basics of SQLite3.

- [ ] Creating a SQLite database
- [ ] Connecting to a SQLite database
- [ ] Creating tables
- [ ] Querying tables
- [ ] Updating tables

### TBA | Using Web Scraping to Get Chess Match Results

This will be a project-focused session wherein each participant will use web scraping to extract chess match results and write them to a SQLite database. We'll write two programs:

- [ ] Scraping chess player profiles to create a table of player and player IDs
- [ ] Scraping chess player match results to create a table of each player and the results of their last 30 matches

### TBA | Intro to Plotly Dash

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with Dash, a popular Python framework for developing data-focused web applications. We'll cover:

- [ ] Installing Dash
- [ ] Creating a 'hello world' application
- [ ] Basic callbacks
- [ ] Bootswatch

### TBA | Intro to Cytoscape

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with Cytoscape, a popular framework for developing knowledge graphs. We'll cover:

- [ ] The use case for knowledge graphs
- [ ] Overview of popular knowledge graph solutions
- [ ] 'Deep dive' on Cytoscape and how to leverage it through Dash applications

### TBA | Building a Knowledge Graph of Chess Match Results

This will be a project-focused session wherein each participant will make a knowledge graph of chess players by combining web scraping + SQLite + Dash + Cytoscape. We'll cover:

- [ ] Structuring data for use in a knowledge graph
- [ ] Developing a static knowledge graph
- [ ] Developing an interactive knowledge graph

### Additional Topics
