## Overview

Welcome to the CMCSSA Data Science group! This group is open to anyone, regardless of prior programming experience.

This group will meet ~1x per month to explore and learn new data science concepts. The classes herein are structured so each class will be useful in and of itself. For participants who join all the sessions, we'll tie everything together at the end of the year by using everything we've learned to build a knowledge graph of chess player and the results of their matches.

## Agenda

### 30 Oct 2022, 2-4pm EST, Charlotte Mecklenburg Library - SouthPark Regional | Setting up your Development Environment

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant has their local development environment set up for the classes to follow. We'll cover:

- [ ] Installing Python
- [ ] Installing a text editor (VSCode)
- [ ] Installing the SQLite browser
- [ ] Creating a virtual environment
- [ ] PIP Installing Python libraries

### TBA | Intro to Python

(This sessions is tentative. If the class is already comfortable with Python then we can skip it and move to the next lesson). The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is comfortable enough with Python to enjoy and learn from the course.

- [ ] Variables, expressions, statements
- [ ] Conditional execution
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Loops and iterations
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Dictionaries

### TBA | Intro to Web Scraping

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant feels comfortable with the basics of web scraping in Python. We'll cover:

- [ ] Understanding the robots.txt file
- [ ] 'Netiquette'
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] Requests
- [ ] Beautiful Soup

### TBA | Into to SQLite

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with the basics of SQLite3.

- [ ] Creating a SQLite database
- [ ] Connecting to a SQLite database
- [ ] Creating tables
- [ ] Querying tables
- [ ] Updating tables

### TBA | Using Web Scraping to Get Chess Match Results

This will be a project-focused session wherein each participant will use web scraping to extract chess match results and write them to a SQLite database. We'll write two programs:

- [ ] Scraping chess player profiles to create a table of player and player IDs
- [ ] Scraping chess player match results to create a table of each player and the results of their last 30 matches

### TBA | Intro to Plotly Dash

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with Dash, a popular Python framework for developing data-focused web applications. We'll cover:

- [ ] Installing Dash
- [ ] Creating a 'hello world' application
- [ ] Basic callbacks
- [ ] Bootswatch

### TBA | Intro to Cytoscape

The purpose of this session is to ensure each participant is familiar with Cytoscape, a popular framework for developing knowledge graphs. We'll cover:

- [ ] The use case for knowledge graphs
- [ ] Overview of popular knowledge graph solutions
- [ ] 'Deep dive' on Cytoscape and how to leverage it through Dash applications

### TBA | Building a Knowledge Graph of Chess Match Results

This will be a project-focused session wherein each participant will make a knowledge graph of chess players by combining web scraping + SQLite + Dash + Cytoscape. We'll cover:

- [ ] Structuring data for use in a knowledge graph
- [ ] Developing a static knowledge graph
- [ ] Developing an interactive knowledge graph

### Additional Topics

If the need arises during the lessons above, or if we have additional time, some additional topics we'll cover include:

- [ ] Intro to Git
- [ ] Setting up a GitHub account
- [ ] Cloning a repo
- [ ] Forking a repo
- [ ] Creating branches
- [ ] Pull/Merge requests
- [ ] Hosting applications## Overview
