# Intro to Pico-8

## Desired outcomes from this session:

The purpose of this lesson is to ensure each participant is comfortable enough with Pico-8 to enjoy and learn from the course. 

## This lesson will cover:

- [ ] **What is Pico-8?**

- [ ] **Using Pico-8**

	- When you first start Pico-8, you are in a mode where you can type commands. Use the ESC key to toggle back and forth between editor mode and command mode. 

- [ ] **The Code Editor**

	- All of your code is written here

	- Each game ('cart') has a token limit of 8192 tokens

- [ ] **The Sprite Editor**

	- Sprites are the pieces of art that make up your game. They might be characters, map tiles, pickups, backgrounds... anything!

	- Pico-8 allows you to have 256 8x8 sprites. These are spread across 4 tabs labeled 0-3. The last two tabs share the same spaces as the map editor, however. 

- [ ] **The Map Editor**

	- Pico-8's map tiles use the 8x8 sprites from the sprite editor.

	- You can have a max map size of 128 tiles wide and 64 tiles tall. 

- [ ] **The Sound Editor**

	- A Pico-8 card can have up to 64 sounds. 

	- Each sound has 32 notes.

- [ ] **The Music Editor**

	- The music editor allows you to create patterns of music using sounds from the sound editor. 

- [ ] **Coordinates**

	- Pico-8's screen is 128 x 128.

	- The coordinate 0,0 is in the top left corner and 127, 127 is in the bottom right.

- [ ] **Programming Basics**

	- Variables

	- Functions

	- Tables

- [ ] **The Game Loop**

	- Init - the code here happens one time when the game starts

	- Update - code here happens 30 times every second

	- Draw - code here also happens 30 times every second, but after update happens

## If we have time, we'll:

- [ ] Make sprites for the 'Fruit Drop' game

- [ ] Begin the 'Fruit Drop' tutorial
